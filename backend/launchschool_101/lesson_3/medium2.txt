1. - Before the block the a_outer and d_outer share the same object id, the other two differ.
   - Object ids remain the same at the first set of #puts calls in the block.
   - At the second set of #puts calls all of the object ids will be different.

3. After the call to #tricky_method my_array will have value ["pumpkins", "rutabaga"] because #<< mutates the caller. my_string will be the same value, because #+ returns a new String with "rutabaga" appeded, but does not mutate my_string.

4. After the call to #tricky_method_two you will have basically the reverse of question 3, the string will get mutated and the array will not for the same reasons (#<< mutates the caller but #= does not).
